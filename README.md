# üåü What is Random¬†Forest?
Random Forest is a supervised learning algorithm that builds a "forest" of decision trees, each trained on a random subset of the data. This approach helps in reducing overfitting, a common issue with single decision trees, by averaging the results from multiple trees to enhance model stability and accuracy. By aggregating the output of several trees, it reduces overfitting and improves accuracy. Think of it as a diverse team of experts sharing their insights to make better decisions!
Let's take an example of a training dataset consisting of various fruits such as bananas, apples, pineapples, and peaches.

<p> The random forest classifier divides this dataset into subsets. These subsets are given to every decision tree in the random forest system. Each decision tree produces its specific output. For example, the prediction for trees 1 and 2 is apple.
However, the third has predicted banana as the outcome. The random forest classifier collects the majority voting to provide the final prediction. The majority of the decision trees have chosen an apple as their prediction. This makes the classifier choose apple as the final prediction.</p>

# üåê How Does Random Forest¬†Work???
## 1. Bootstrapping:

Random Forest uses a technique called bootstrapping to create multiple subsets of the training data. Each subset is created by randomly sampling the data with replacement. This means that some observations may appear multiple times in a subset, while others may not appear at all.

## 2. Building Decision Trees:
For each bootstrapped dataset, a decision tree is constructed. However, unlike traditional decision trees, which consider all features when making a split, Random Forest only considers a random subset of features at each split. This randomness helps to ensure that the trees are diverse and reduces the risk of overfitting.

## 3. Voting/Averaging:
Once all the decision trees are built, the Random Forest makes predictions by aggregating the predictions from each tree. For classification tasks, the final prediction is made based on majority voting (the class that gets the most votes from the trees). For regression tasks, the predictions are averaged

## 4. Feature Importance:
Random Forest can also provide insights into the importance of different features in making predictions. This is done by measuring how much each feature contributes to the reduction of impurity in the trees.
